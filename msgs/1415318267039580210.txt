Did some testing on opening URLs in Linux, doesn't seem to work with the following combination:
1. Packaged Singular as an AppImage (required some electron-forge config)
2. Installed using Gearlever: https://flathub.org/en/apps/it.mijorus.gearlever
3. Tested opening URL via Junction: https://flathub.org/en/apps/re.sonny.Junction

Just opens the default window and not the requested page.
