i used to build pre llm chatbots  (thats what they must mean in the question) . the best platform was Dialogflow CX which is still around but probably integrates with gemini now for some features. it was fun but no one knew how to do it well, so what everyone experienced was only the worst of what is possible. was also  a nice programming experience, the model is a bit like a mixture of state machine and constraint driven programming. there was a whole conversational design category emerging including ui elements and mini apps to use in conversations , but it all basically died with gpt 3.
