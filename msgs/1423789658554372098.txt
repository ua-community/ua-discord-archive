for example there is nothing inherently *human-readable* or *ubiquitous* about  plaintext, although we take it for granted today. It's this massive collections of standards/protocols/conventions that have developed over the decades.  It's this massive conglomeration of things and their distribution across all computing devices (i.e. infrastructure) that makes plaintext ubiquitous and prevents single-system dominance.
