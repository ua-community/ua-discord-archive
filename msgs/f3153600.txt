looking for feedback again. i found one reason people start a new window is being overwhelmed by the number of tabs and wanting this "new sheet of paper"©   feeling.  im experimenting with the ability to pull down a full sidebar, creating a little spacer and a bit of space, so you get a bit of this feeling without having to start a new space.

does this look wrong/broken? does this only make sense in my head or is somethig that resonates with other users?
