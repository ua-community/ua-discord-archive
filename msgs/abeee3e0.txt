Hmm what should the first “output” (userdata storage) component be… I’m thinking:
- Some dumb storage that just stores your (encrypted) bytes where you can authenticate with a passkey (does this even exist?)
- Storacha (closest thing I know to the above)
- Automerge repo client
- Something something Iroh?
