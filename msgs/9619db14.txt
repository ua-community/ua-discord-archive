Is anyone up to date on databases / full text search in the browser?
I wonder how these two things overlap.
Looking for the most performant way to do full text search in the browser.

Currently using Orama, since I guess that sets me up for natural language search as well?

(using this to search through user-owned data, so still on topic 🙈)
