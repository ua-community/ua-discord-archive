Take a use-case like "fetch my data from {n} platforms where I have accounts". With sub-extensions you might have a parent extension that defines an interface that sub-extensions implement. There's a standardized lifecycle and processing pipeline. That consistency might be good for many reasons - single authoring target, ease of debugging, common tooling. A downside is that it's tightly coupled - everything must be authored according to that interface. Not all things might fit the abstraction well. Or some devs might just not target it for whatever reason, and do something different.
