One bummer about custom elements (even unregistered ones) is that you pay a non-trivial cost per non-inert node when loading up a document, and that can make it feel like a worse approach compared to almost any non-DOM-based option.

But, there are always trade-offs. Self-modifying HTML is so cool. It's probably worth it.

Also CSS is so good these days. It's always been fast for what it is, but now it is also quite feature-rich.
