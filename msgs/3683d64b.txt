(user)  keep us updated about your twiddler learning curve. im currently looking for a controller that is like a draydream or gear vr controller but with more buttons and more high fidelity. basically a small device that fits in one hand and has a thumb trackpad, gyro, accels and maybe a microphone. you aware of anything nice?
