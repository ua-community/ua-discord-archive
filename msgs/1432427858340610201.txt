afaik the OC works in two different ways. there is a bunch of small donations that are used for servers/hosting and random small event expenses which are all no brainers. then there are bigger projects which just start to form and are experimented with. but those are first agreed on and then payed by someone who funds the specifc cause. there is no format yet in which there is first a bigger sum of money in OC and then it would be distributed by a process to some proejects/ research. this would be quite interesting, hope we reach a theshold where we can experiment with formats for this
