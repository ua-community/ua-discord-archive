“Our approach can be viewed as a form of model merging—combining multiple models into a single unified model [4, 5, 6]. However, FlexOlmo is specifically designed to address the unique challenges of our setting: merging models that have been pre-trained on entirely disjointed datasets with differing distributions. We show that prior model merging techniques struggle in this scenario, whereas FlexOlmo is able to handle it effectively.”
