Last week, we open-sourced a (still highly experimental) project: Dialog DB.

You can find the Github project here: https://github.com/dialog-db/dialog-db

The properties of Dialog DB include:

- The core of the implementation is Rust (delivered as Wasm)
- The high-level API is TypeScript and includes an optional React hook
- Data is held in a [triplestore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triplestore)
- Data is retrieved using a [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) inspired query engine
- Queries can be executed over sparse replicas of the database (including replicas with no data at all)
   - The database can infer from the query the minimum slice of the data that must be replicated to respond to the query, and fetches it behind the scenes
- The database is offline / local-first: reads and writes are allowed on the local data (including on sparse replicas)
  - The only network infrastructure expected by the database is a "dumb" file store e.g., Amazon S3
