open ai had a great talk about their implementation at sync conf, should be published soonish. they said its impossible to use one approach for everything but have a mix of approaches that are mix and matched with fallbacks to full regeneration and diff patch. one of the problems was that llms lose a few iq points when generating a direct patch vs regeneration. they also developed a patch format that llms are able to reliably use as they suck at line counting. regarding crdts i would just use git and have a reliable proven data model, you dont need character based crdt for an llm and crdts will not preserve intentions anyways and lose data on conflicts.
