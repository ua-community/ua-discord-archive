For context <#1463684823645421765> is working name for collective community compute currently hosted in Bangkok (potentially at some point with nodes in other locations) that will be available for use by projects and folk in the U&A community. My aim with this project is to help accelerate our progress in increasing agency and learn a bunch of stuff in the process.
