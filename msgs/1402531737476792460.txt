This can work rn if we had a continual learning based SLM on device, presently we donâ€™t have that. Most model experiences only store either short term things through RAG or long term through static weights, so key is to have fast personal weight updates on device/any other secure method like TEE, we can imagine people tapping to each other phone to exchange such details like they do rn for contacts on iPhones
