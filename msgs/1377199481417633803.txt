I subscribed to claude max plan as I was kinda pissed at burning so many credits and worrying about cost when using claude code and figured rather than run it locally on my machine with the latency perhaps better to run it in firebase workstation. It works great and gives you claude code running in terminal session within web based vscode. You can preview the app via browser and also in paraellel chat to gemini about the project. I've found it helpful to have gemini doing reviews of claude's work and suggesting improvements. You can have the two of them use a file to message the other. e.g. hey claude egemini has some suggestions for you in gemini_nodes_for_claude.md let me know what you think. Then it will write back to gemini in claude_nodes_for_gemini.md. Having the two of them agree and disagree is kinda fun with the human being the tie breaker / project manager.
