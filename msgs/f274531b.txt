So I'm low-interest on most "local first" stuff, since it's usually take-away-able. It often it doesn't empower me, nor us *first*. It's usually server-first, and inevitably turns into a crowd: me, you and some 3rd party publisher who can take away the things we made and the places we hung out. A 3rd party which gets to decide if it all goes "server not found" or 404, instead of me, or us.
