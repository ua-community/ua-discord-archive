> This does not necessarily mean we need more capable LLMs. Having used every Claude release since Claude 2, I can confidently state that this failure mode will not be solved by larger models alone — LLMs have gotten significantly better at one-shotting tasks with the limited information we tend to give them, but nothing will enable a pre-trained LLM to understand your codebase without exploring it in the first place. To return to our analogy: A skilled software developer may be able to onboard to your codebase very quickly, but no matter how skilled they are, they will always perform better if they are told exactly what they need to do from the beginning of a task.
This makes me wonder if an SLM can be good enough if the processes around it are better
