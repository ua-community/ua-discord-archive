Quite interesting, although I wonder about this section:
> Banks could also offer LedgerLoops-compatible bank accounts, making it easier for their customers to trade with unbanked neighbors.

Doesn't the whole concept rely on only promising things to people you trust?
If I trust the bank, aren't classical ledgers outright better?
