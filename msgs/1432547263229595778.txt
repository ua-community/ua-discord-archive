Big ❤️ to the general drift (user). For my part, the reason I intentionally *not* treading down the road of figuring out broader governance is because it should be decided here as a group when it's needed. Maybe this is the time, since you're asking these questions. The questions you are asking are good ones, and they should be asked to the group, not to me specifically. Happy to participate, if you or anyone else want to start down this road.
