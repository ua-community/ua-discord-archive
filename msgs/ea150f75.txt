My hope for this year is that I can instruct an open-source local llm to use Diffuse elements to generate a media browser or player that behaves and looks exactly as instructed. Generating software based on needs.

eg. generate an overview of all my albums grouped by year and genre, with cover images from musicbrainz, and have that connected to an existing player interface in another tab/window
