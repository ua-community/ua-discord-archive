as rendering is happening on servers gpu it should be pretty decent. 100fps and 3 ms latency locally possible but not at extreme resolutions. also dont know what remote optimizations would be needed. for game streaming there are also lots of optimized streaming tools. this is really unique in that its a general purpose graphics pipeline eg with perfect text , which is often meh on game streaming setups
