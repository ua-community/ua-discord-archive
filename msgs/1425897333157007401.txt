One aspect is that agency is more than *owning* data. Owning data is meaningless if you don't have the ability to perform computation.

For example, when you download your twitter archive, it's a website with JSON file of tweets/data. For most people, the dont have agency over their twitter archive because they can't do anything with it (unless developers create specific tools).
