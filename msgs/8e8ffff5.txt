Amp's /handoff is frelling frag-tastically good.

Instead of a /compact, you kind of proactively are encouraged to /handoff to a new agent. You give it a little prompt:
/handoff "do the whizbang feature"

And it runs an agent to take your short prompt & turn it into a nice contextual long prompt for the new agent. It's amazing at this.
