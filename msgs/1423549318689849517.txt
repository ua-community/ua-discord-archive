*On what platforms & engines and how many are you running* 
We're not exposing the browers directly. They are accessable via API to facilitate automated action taking on the web. We'll be supporting both Firefox and Chromium based browsers. 

*Extraction from? any webapp? *
We're building systems to access webpages in a variety of structured ways - such as the developer providing a specific .json schema of what they want and how it should be organized. Retrieving as Markdown etc. is supported as well. 

*Configurable "deep research" style elements*
More on this soon!

*Is this work for mozilla?*
Yes! I'm working on a team that's part of  Mozilla's New Products division. We're building technology to help developers connect their AI systems to the web more simply. 

*mozilla search?? ðŸ‘€*
This project isn't search. Our research tools will help you get quick answers from the web in a format that's right for your system.
