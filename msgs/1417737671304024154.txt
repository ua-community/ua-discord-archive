many mixed feelings about this

- a compnay calling itself something like  "interaction company of california" is just so pretentious smells like the browser company of new york ptsd
- the personality is super annoying and rude, reminds me of early dia agent personality which i found unbearable  and rude
-  normal messenger with notifications and a much simpler interface also used for humans actually feels different, but there is always a point where you need more agent specific ui and i doubt messengers will be able to add that anytime soon given how long it took for even buttons to be added to most platforms and even that is still a mess, plus the api, interop and data ownership mess of messengers
- their video ending is more frightening than they realise and reminds me more of the bot encouraging the guy to commit suicide
- permission uis and system in general of the last decade are  just utterly incapable for this world  and have to die.  i would never grant something like this access up front to something as general as downloading all contacts and email.
