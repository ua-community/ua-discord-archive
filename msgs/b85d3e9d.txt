ah right the point was lexicons are immutable so they cannot break if your app does not like the new version the domain owner published you dont have to use it, worst thing that can happen is you clone lexicon with your own changes. no way to migrate existing data though without breaking every link to it so now your app needs to support both. but same is true for breaking changes in own lexicon
