🫡  . I really can't give ampcode enough credit. They're doing everything right. It's closed source but they are so far ahead, so so so good. Their ability to pick the right model for the job is amazing. Give them some money and they'll use it well, not waste your credits, get amazing shit done. I struggle to convey how much respect I have for ampcode, to elaborate how it is so good. Even their free plans are very very very good. Very glad you've enjoyed.
