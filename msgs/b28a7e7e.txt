well  sounds funny because pure matrix is always e2e encrypted client side. but  with mautrix you have eg. signal e2e encryption and matrix e2e encryption and then bridges that decrypt and have to reencrypt, but if the bridge runs on someones server eg. beeper its unencrypted there. so to have e2e encrypted clientside mautrix you need to run the bridges clientside, at that point unless you actually want matrix servers, the client might as well pretend to be a matrix server that directly integrates with the mautrix bridges.
