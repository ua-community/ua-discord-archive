Its chorded. You can make it do whatever but iirc most layouts tend to have the top row basically select a mode of operation. That's a bit oversimplified and rarely advertised as such, but I remember having some 💡 moment ~3 months in. Definitely takes time to learn, but being able to type and move about was so neat.
