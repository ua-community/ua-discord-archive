Really appreciated Baldur Bjarnason's negative take on workers-oauth-push. I thought this was a really good & interesting project by Kenton Varga, really interesting public example, useful output. But also hadn't seen these CVE's, & nice hearing some counter-perspectives. https://bsky.app/profile/baldurbjarnason.com/post/3lqsam5op2x26
