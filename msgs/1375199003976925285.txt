Our primitive for shapes in the canvas is a custom HTML attribute and one of the features it has is auto position (document flow) and auto width/height. So it allows you to can shapes in the canvas in and out of document flow. One place it's useful for is the ability to adversarially "canvasify" web pages via a web extension. B ut I also think it could be useful for mobile/responsiveness. With a couple of lines of CSS you can turn the canvas back into a responsive document, which gets us close to what you suggested.
