Peeps it HAS happened. dont ask me how i know this but vivaldis maximum number of tabs is 530. it does not check for it it just loses data after it and the interface becomes unusable. safaris limit used to be 500 after wich it would start recycling your last used tab without telling you so if you went back to older tabs they were just missing, but if you know it you could avoid losing data. but vivaldi now lost all my tab pins and a a few tabs i had and the interface is so slow and untrustable in this state that i dont even know if i can trust it to clean the spaces without losing more data. the backups are just the proifle folders so its near impossible to diff them without proper tooling to see what is missing and you cannot just merge in parts from an older backup into something else. this is exactly what i am working on to make sure to NEVER heappen and i am writing a blog post about what i call "a data substrate for user agency - a successor to local first" i really want to do this in a dialog with all of you and would love to get your input.
