Website for the 4.0 alpha has gotten a bit better as well:
https://elements.diffuse.sh/4.0.0-alpha/

- "Take control" section is live.
- Demo works great with the constituents.
- Added a bunch of "element todos" that hopefully give a good idea of the direction.

Still so much to do, but the bare minimum is now there (if you don't count support for audio streams).
