Pretty interesting project, but feels like they are not quite honest about what it can and cannot do... I was about to try it out when I read in their js runtime project:
> Some Javascript features are not supported yet:
> - Promises and micro-tasks
> - Some Javascript types, including Arrays
> - Function overloading
> - Types static methods
> - Non-optional nullable types

I'm pretty sure this breaks practically all non-static websites
