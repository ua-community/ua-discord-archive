Gonna put some ideating about my UI engine project in here. It's gonna support components, which generate an element tree, which will generate a sequence of command buffers, which I can then submit to the queue all at once. However, I also want fine grained reactivity from the components down to the command buffers, so I wanna be smarter than a naive UI = f(state). Therefore, both the element tree and command buffer list must persist and be mutable, such that small changes in the components only drive small changes in the command buffers and the whole thing is not recomputed every frame.
