Thinking about this a bit more as a spectrum of how / where code runs... 

* in page as script
* in page as esm imported module
* in worker (on local machine)
* in worker on server (e.g. winter tc, cf, deno, etc)
* in web container (in wasm, but locally)
* locally on the same machine (e.g. via bun as sidecar under tauri)
* in container such as podman (e.g. under linux vm, e.g. vite dev) 
* in container or vm remotely
