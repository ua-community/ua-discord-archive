You know, if we just made a lightweight social layer in browsers around browser tabs and tab groups, we could take out like 90% of enterprise everything apps. The sidebars are just tabs in tabs. Which, if we superapp things a la <#1378770757731094608>, all these tools could just become browsers chrome themselves.

Yes, I know I just contradicted myself. But the hilarious thing is every single app like this wanting to become your browser shell and organize each other's tabs within itself.
