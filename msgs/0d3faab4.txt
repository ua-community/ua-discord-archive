Yup - for my purposes I think building the most solid foundations possible is the most important thing.
I haven't written this up, but I think of it as "engineering for accidents". Build amazing foundations, and products just happen to pop out by "accident".
(Products as in "usable things" not something that value can be extracted from necessarily)
