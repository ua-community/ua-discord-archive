I don't find cursor in automode genuinely useful. I know many people do, and I use it here and there, but it's not that functional for what I do.
But just now I converted a 25-minute recording into a somewhat structured draft, that with some extra work I'd integrate into my notes.
And in the middle of that I can set reminders, kick off research queries & get background info.
It's more like Google assistant++, and I always found Google assistant to be genuinely useful. Just limited, but still useful. Expanding that to more and more stuff seems exciting.
