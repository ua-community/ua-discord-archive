I don't think people understand that what they've come up with is literally "I want an algorithm that does x" and it literally just does it.
Not in some AI way with bells and whistles, but in a proven optimal way. Producing idiomatic code. No "you give three examples and it generates if/else with the correct answers", just correct code that I'd write after thinking about it for a while.
