Right now we use browsers to access web apps but not really run web apps.. they live on GitHub in repos that regular folk don’t know how to access. Something like darc should be able to run any of these apps. And people shouldn’t really be concerned about what kind of app. Most apps I use are web apps but it would be nice if it could also run Linux or other native apps and have them mixed in.
