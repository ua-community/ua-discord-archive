BTW, here's https://github.com/tileshq/mcp-cli - a dead-simple CLI client and library of MCP, wrapped on top of the MCP's official Typescript SDK. It's got adaptive HTTP/SSE transport and OAuth, which I believe covers all methods of interacting with existing remote MCP servers (for e.g, https://mcpservers.org/remote-mcp-servers). The idea is to build a nice MCP client library that you can just import and use in any kind of interfaces, such as https://tiles.run.
