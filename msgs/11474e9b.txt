My idea was not a really strong idea, it was just a prototype to see what Darc could do. I wanted to have a clipboard manager (which just passively grabs things) and then I wanted to experiement with doing some type of 'more searching' on those terms. It was meant as a type of directed assitant that would allow you to pick up various ideas/concepts/people/places while you're reading a document and basically turn that into more links for you to explore
