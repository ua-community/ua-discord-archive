The Editor extension in Peek is now something I am using for everything - nothing too crazy, CodeMirror and some stuff around it... but it's the editor I've always wanted:

- Three panes: outline, editor, preview
- Easy pane hide/show
- Vim bindings (not full, but enough)
- Fold at indent, markdown header and list
- Folds synced to outline and vice-versa
