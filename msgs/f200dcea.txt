I think there's a good idea here. PDS migration to one with the abstraction, with some assistance for temporary backwards compatibility. It could be handled entirely within the new PDS system I think. My PDS migration would not break any of your links to me, but it could change some of your links to my content, so maybe my new PDS just has to grandfather in the old CIDs for backwards compability and we're good to go. 🤔
