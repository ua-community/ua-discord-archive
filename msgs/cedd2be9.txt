Right, but this is basically just rendering tools / tool calls, no?
There's no way for the agent to highlight "I modified this pages content" (no idea how darc works, but you get the idea).
It may have done 1 or 100 tool calls to get there, but it can tell me this is the important bit, and I can click it to quickly find the results.
Different use case to tool (call) rendering I think
