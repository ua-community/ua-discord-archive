Google are shipping so many different AI tools these days so its hard to keep up but one of them I checked out is firebase.studio. This is not firebase db as you might expect its a loveable like tool for building apps using ai. While thats cool it has two modes.. chat ui (loveable / replit like clone) and code/dev mode which is more like vscode + gemini in the cloud with a google firebase workspace (vm). This second mode is most intersting as its basically a computer running on google cloud you can access terminal, install things as you wish, etc. You can host dev envs and access things running on the ports via subdomains. If you just signup for firebase.studio you get 3 of these workstation/vms but if you signup for free as "google developer" (just fill out a form) they increase your limit to 10!
