I don't think this is at odds with what I said at all. It's conceivable that the rendered view is just access to the DOM.
I doubt that this is possible while maintaining the security model of the current web, but opting out of that is possible of course.

Imo message passing is the fundamental abstraction, just barely above raw memory access. Still allows *some* abstraction, filtering, composition, but stays incredibly flexible.
