Sharing a little of the hardware side quest I've been on. A few months back before rammageddon hit I figured it might be a good hedge to secure a decent amount of local compute. The prospect of running AI and workloads locally appealed and have been following folks like digital spaceport, OxSero, who have been building custom rigs for a while now. So I ordered some epyc server parts from china and sourced ram and GPUs locally before prices went crazy. I have a tendency to overdo things and this time is no exception. Anyway, upshot is something that hardware wise looks a lot like the kit cloudflare runs on mixed with some crazed home-brew crypto mining setup. A poor mans 1/2 oxide rack with side of GPUs. It’s too much to run all of it in my office at home so I’m moving most of it to a space in Bangkok with stable power, decent connectivity and most important cooling. Hope to be done with the setup by the end of the week. After that I plan to open it up for experiments, hosting agents, growing browsers, really anything community needs. Will share some more updates here later this week or perhaps create a channel for hardware / homebrew super computer projects.
