From the OC administration standpoint, I'll reiterate that more admins would be great. We started this space specifically around the idea of group of *people* interested in software that increases user agency, as distinct from a *company* or a specific technology. More people participating in the definition of it is a healthy signal. So far, there's not been much to do (which is a bit of mixed signal!).
