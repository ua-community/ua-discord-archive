side note: i was rapping w/ someone still working on the Web Features project full time for Google yesterday, and it sounds like Baseline/WF might evolve to 1) capture the whole lifecycle of a "web feature" and 2) start including single-vendor features in a way that is better than pretending they don't exist.
