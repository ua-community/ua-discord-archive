For me web applets are an (important) tool for composting the web as it is and making an incremental step towards a more malleable future. It takes existing web pages and make it's internal state addressable, but it requires cooperation from the author and the protocol (postMessage) inherently limits how much can be addressable. I think it highlights the difference between permissioned vs. permissionless extensibility.
