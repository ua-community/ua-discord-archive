Thank you so much for letting me know. While I'm obviously familiar with the issue/challenge, I have to admit upfront I have very little experience with CSAM implementation. One of the first questions with any FOSS project is cost.  I'm *not* suggesting we shouldn't find a way to pay for it, I'm saying any time you add cost to a FOSS project, things are just that much harder. I expect some numbers wrt cost/user for a larger server would go a long way to scoping out the impact.
