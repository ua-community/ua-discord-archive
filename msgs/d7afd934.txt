ideally i just want cameras in my rooms that can watch me and have great gesture recongition & detecting but that's prbably not actually as good a future as my decades of hoping for it has been.

still, fun to see some shifts towards that. wearing sensors still short of that but still neat. and hopefully makes good data to actually do it with cameras / lidar.
