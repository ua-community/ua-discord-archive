(user) (user) catching up on the great discussion from yesterday.

The question of whether or not one's ideals may interfere with the goal (which I think we all share) of enabling user agency is a very interesting one.

A problem that comes up when discussing user agency is that not everyone shares the same understanding of what user agency even looks like.

Can you offer your definition and/or portrait of user agency?
