i feel infinite software is becoming a reality. i finished my first three vibe coded projects in a language i dont know anything about. i  made the android launcher in kotlin that i always wanted but no one wanted except me (working like webOS where the home screen is the list of app cards, not the list off app icons)   
i made the best air mouse i ever used out of a switch controller and an abandoned c++ project fixing the bugs that made it unusable and adding the features that i was missing.  ported c++ deskflow from linux/debian to android/termux native.   oh and  fixing the build and compiling  linux gpu drivers for android. all tasks i have zero knowledge about and i could not even imagine how to start before yet alone accomplish
