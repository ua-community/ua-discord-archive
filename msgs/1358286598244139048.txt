I've not seen anything exactly like this. Worked some folks on a Glif.io feature that was a slider for donating a % of your staking returns to an open source pooled fund, was experimental and never shipped. Endaoment has some of the pieces, but are focused only non-profit. The pieces are not spectacularly complicated, but it's definitely not without challenges. While the idea is lenders get 100% of their money back, it's neither zero risk nor 100% liquid for the lender. Staking returns are variable, so it's not a truly stable income stream for the beneficiary until a certain scale. That scale also means that you need a pretty large stake ratio - eg if you require $2k/mo to pay for existence you need a LOT more than that staked by your supporters. Very Large Pools smooth out a lot of those issues, but don't remove them entirely.
