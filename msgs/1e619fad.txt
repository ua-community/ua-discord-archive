Here are the layers, as I see them:
0. RISC-V, open source ISA
1. Rust, memory safe performant systems programming language
2. RedoxOS, microkernel with capability based security model
3. Plurality of physical network layers, with meshes and back hauls
4. Reticulum, cryptography based network stack
--- This is where it gets fuzzier because the ideal tech doesn't full exist yet ---
5. AT Proto but with more identity sovereignty instead of just PLC
6. UI engine with components, signals, and object capabilities
7. Sociocratic software tools
