another drama material thread

tailwind folks refused to add LLM friendly rules to their documentation so some people were disappointed.
And the reason being, they want folks to visit their docs website instead of LLMs because they need to advertise their paid service. They had to lay off 75% of their people 

It seems the docs are the only way people find out about their paid features. Idk if that's even optimal in the current age. But yeah not taking sides
