Trying to sell decentralization is like trying to sell a car by convincing people they need to buy an engine. People dont give a shit about engines. People want a working car. And you don't sell the car, you sell what the car gets you. Decentralization is multiple layers of narrative abstraction away from being a viable sales strategy.
