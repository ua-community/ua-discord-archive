so i would argue we need both. tabs for windows that work on os level and are not constrained by one app. so you can tab eg. a browser window and you vscode window.  and a sidebar with the  actual data of your browsing session that is treated as sacred as any user data. eg. i find it extremely offensive chrome asks me if i want to restore my tabs.
