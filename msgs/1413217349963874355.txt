Hopefully a bit more clear explanation of my UCAN + applets exploration.

Data provider could be anything: automerge, ipfs, dropbox, s3, etc.
Not sure what the capabilities will be yet, it's possible to do granular data access.

Like (user) said, this signed receipt is portable and you could add time limitations to this (or any other limitations you can think of really).
