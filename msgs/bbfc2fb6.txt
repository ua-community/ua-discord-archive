we delayed the agent a bit because the sdk situation is still too unstable with cloudflare agents , mistral, vercel ai sdk, tanstack ai, or build from scractch, would be annoying to put too much work into something outdated in a few weeks plus most are too immature to even properly evaluate. open webui does a bit too much to be inside the browser. but i  it would be great to have it as an extension  and placeholder so we can wait even longer until we have to build. is the ui flexible with styling and making it work as a sidebar?
