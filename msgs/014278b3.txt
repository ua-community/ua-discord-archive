just went down that rabbit hole. did plenty of benchmarking and found a good setup that im protyping now.  the setup is a bit more complex than for indexeddb but abilty to run arbitrary queries including fulltext and then optimize later with indices as well as double performance for common scenarios seems worth it.  most interesting setup:   sahpool persistence  wasm sqlite  from original release with WAL and synchronous = NORMAL, exclusive locking_mode , combination of shared worker and dedicated worker to be able to use across tabs without the bs that rxdb is doing.
