Continuing the thread of exploring the different ai surfaces provided by major players. Google have some other interfaces other than Gemini, two that I'm aware of are AI Studio and Firebase Studio. AI Studio can generate artifacts but you have to save locally, so not great. Firebase Studio is more interesting, "app prototyper" sort of interface able to generate both client and client/server apps which are hosted in firebase workspace. These can add npm imports and come with git, can be connected to github, or any git remote, give you full cloud based terminal etc. Publishing seems to assume firebase project hosting but you can do your own thing and use another host. Overall interesting as you get 3 workspaces for free and they seem quite powerful. Gemini is also included for free it seems although I'm not sure exactly what version its using. You can upgrade to 10 workspaces if you join google dev program (for free) or get 30 if you pay 299 a year. I'm not totally sure what a workspace entails, if its keeps running or will spin up on demand etc.
