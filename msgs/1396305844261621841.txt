I started crate digging for newer music from a genre I thought died in 2018 and I've found stuff that I enjoy that is newer but I cant shake the fear that its been created by AI instead of by someone that has taken the time to sit behind an SB1200 and make a good beat and then take the time to tinker around with synth cords until they have made something enjoyable and then put pen to paper to write lyrics that are relatable
