Lately I have been moving towards something inherently faster (that better facilitates livecoding) but I have other ideas like adding topological contours, or more direct shaping of nodes. I think one of the bigger failings is an inability to imagine new means of graphing and visualizing this kind of interface and relational structure is the lack of fielding artistic inputs and otherwise looking at the problem from a purely computational standpoint. Ultimately I see moving forwards as something that is a spacial relation that is quite different to normal abstractions of computing, and as much as I enjoy the 'modular synth wiring' paradigm of node graphs I agree that the failings of previous implementations remain unaddressed, and that I think we underserve what could be offered and should strive to do far, far better
