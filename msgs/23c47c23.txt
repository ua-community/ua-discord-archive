I feel like all of these have different preconceptions, or maybe it's just me.

Plugin = A small foundation, lots of plugins to extend functionality (most of the time there's a decent amount of base plugins)

Add-on, or extension = Large, solid product which can be modified slightly.

Mod = Huge product that can be modified, often only IF allowed. Cannot diverge too far from the original product. Games can provide builders to enable more use-cases.
