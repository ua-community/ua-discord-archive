Talking random thoughts into my computer and getting Gemini 3 to natively process it feels VERY good. 10/10 can recommend. A little expensive I suppose, but worth it.
I always wanted a dictaphone and now I can even tell it to ignore an example I gave / add action points while talking and it just works. Amazing. Gotta work on a prompt to give it together with the audio file though
