I work in Golang/K8s security, cloud native. Totally opposite of anything local first lol. And I am paid peanuts, just enough to get by paycheck to paycheck. Better than nothing I guess. Although I'm finding work more on low-level/local first type, tough to get in this job market anyway. Slowly building out my portfolio to change domains
