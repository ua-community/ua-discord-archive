im not an expert on terms but afaik sovereignty is a distinct concept that is way more overloaded and often includes things like identity and applications themselves plus has a troubled political meaning ( please correct me (user)  )  the goal of a data ownership stream is to explicitly exclude the convoluted  parts and whats tackled somewhere else ( eg identity, local first software ) to focus on something tangible that will fall off  the sides in other groups. data ownership in this sense means supporting the legal right and software tools to give users as complete and as realtime, machine readable and computable access with as little gatekeeping and friction to data about them, or created by them or by their network
