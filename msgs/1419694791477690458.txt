dropping the idea to use third party on device models, and instead will use first party default models present on device

strategy is to finetune lora adapters for memory that stores the user's profile on device, and act as a secure memory custodian by design

incentives for agents to integrate with tiles SDK would be that they get subset of relevant memory data to make better intent suggestions on a verified profile, vice versa user's can verify agent's authenticity too

no need to make a registry anymore
