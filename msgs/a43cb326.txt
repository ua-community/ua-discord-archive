the short answer is the "p2p dies when i shut my laptop" problem. the longer answer is that solving that problem means co-ops not single companies. i've long dreamt of distributed p2p utility cloud (why i've been poking at Bittensor over the last year). IPVM was in similar direction - a core piece was distributed immutable "functions" on IPFS, eg "execute once, result available everywhere". so to be able to make publishing from Peek actually resilient, need something in place.
