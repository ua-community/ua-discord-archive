Hey all! 

I'm looking to pickup some more contracts(diversify) if anyone knows of anything 🙂 

Predominately Typescript these days, but open to pretty much whatever language-wise.

7 years at mozilla, 2 at protocol labs, 2 years as Head of Engineering at ai/music industry startup CreateSafe. Lots of contract work alongside of that, very flexible with different technologies, applications, problems etc
