I don't know. I for some reason just didn't expect it. I come from software development, where as you probably agree, it's a bit complicated. AI is impressive, but not something I hand of to 100%. But basic everyday tasks like reminding myself of things, recording ideas, interacting with tools, etc. it can do really well. And I kind of only realized this now ^^
