> Transitioning to community ownership
> In 2022, Open Collective Inc. announced its commitment to an "exit to community," a pledge to evolve from a traditional startup into a community-owned platform.
> 
> That vision became reality in 2024, when stewardship of the platform transitioned to a new nonprofit: the Open Finance Consortium Inc. (OFiCo), a U.S. 501(c)(6) association created by and for the fiscal hosts and communities who rely on it.
> 
> OFiCo now governs the platform collectively, while its subsidiary OFi Technologies (OFiTech) operates the platform. Together, they continue the original Open Collective mission: enabling transparent, collaborative finance for communities everywhere.
