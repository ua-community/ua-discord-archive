i mean its not JUST a reomote desktop protocol. this is as close to a native rendering pipeline as we can currently get to render linux apps in a browser and its more interesting for local setups right now. im thinking about running apps in containers and using webtop to then use the apps uis as regular tabs.

this gets 100fps on HD video and clear text rendering without tear.

if also remote latency is maneagable, this can also be a base image to allow eg. (user)  to play with darc without any setup. the possibilities are endless
