been playing around with this idea for a while, think there are giant gains happening already with more modest rules similar to the tobacco and alcohol advertising rules in most countries. banning ads on sweets and labelling anything as sweet with more sugar than  healthy would already save thousands of lives. banning ads without opt out or featuring faces or bodies would also be great.
