Then again in my "rebranding" I was thinking of doubling down on making Agregore "for developers / tinkerers / hackers" and use tech words. I'm hoping to empower folks that have *some* web tech knowledge but might not necessarily be professionals. IMO "consumers" are stuck in needing limited mobile apps and don't seem to have a drive for p2p web tech.
