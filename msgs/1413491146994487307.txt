yeah thats why i said the limit of support would be where something is made to be used at scale.  like resellers for fake accounts, professional scraping etc.   but there will always be the gray area of a crazy user who has 10 agents creating and account and    stalking someone with creepy messages or posting his    tech bro hustle project everywhere.
