A tension I've been feeling and trying to put a name to is how emotions around the web as an ideal and moral good clouds our thinking about things.  Does the open web ideology get in the way or support of building tools for agency? I keep thinking my feelings around the open web may be undermining the ideals that lead me to having those feelings about the open web.
