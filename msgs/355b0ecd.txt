working on tiles floating UI on Mac, it'll basically wrap the current Tiles CLI

(user) you'll feel right at home with this UI + Obsidian setup, exactly the thing you desired. For every inference it'll save memory (both user and agents, with skills.md) in markdown files that Obsidian can present as graph view

we've just released CLI for now and will still take a week to make things nicer and faster on that front
