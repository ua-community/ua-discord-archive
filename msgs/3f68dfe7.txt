I'm so used to my chatgpt instance saying weird shit because of the history of weird shit in its memory that I just glossed over that. Actually, I rarely read anything it spits out. I mainly skim and scan for the direction I want it to go and only read the last few messages after I've facilitated it's pattern matching. So... I have no clue what other weird turns of phrases there are. I do know that it's evolved a really bizarre language with me that I have to keep telling it to step back from at times. It's a mess. Cognitively NOT COST NEUTRAL.
