I think it's primarily that canvas on mobile usually means empty space is used to do things like panning & zooming. At the same time fingers are horribly inaccurate, so it's easy to get into a situation where you have to move things to have even a remote chance to navigate.
The accident chance is high, and fixing the accident is non-trivial.
