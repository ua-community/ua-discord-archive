this reminds me of the arrogance of vim/emacs devs who assume everyone in the world is typing / user input constrained, when in reality typing less is more desirable in most cases where limits are perception and reviews, decisions etc.. i also dont use keyboard shortcuts in many situations because i just enjoy using a pointing device more  and it feels more flowy as long as i have something to think about queued up
