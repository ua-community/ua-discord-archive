Using a background web app or content script with some glue connectors is loosely-coupled. It provides more authoring diversity and can be applied to a wider set of platforms/services using different tools or patterns. The boundary is at the address level, not a specific API, so the lifecycle is familiar to webdevs. But it might trade away shared tooling and consistency in debugging that more standard interface would get, for example. And there's bloat / bighammer risk, and probably more overhead than needed for some service integrations.
