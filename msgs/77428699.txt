I did a proof-of-concept a long time ago which re-implemented the core of Ubiquity where each command was a URL opened in a hidden iframe using postMessage to communicate w/ the main page hosting the GCLI. The idea was that web pages were command sources, and could take command input, and stream back suggestions, render command previews, etc. I didn't really take it past some basic examples, but I've always wanted to poke at the idea again, but using a different a surface that scales better than remote web pages. Eg, some kind of bundled web app - which is kinda what a lot of the extensions basically are in these systems.
