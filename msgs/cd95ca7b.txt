this one was an oddly similar look, round screen + cam, nothing else, but designed for making at home w/ all Adafruit-able components:

- 3d-printed case
- pi-zero
- cam
- low-res round screen

you hang it on the wall, configure direct connection to someone else who has one, and when it detects you (proximity iirc) it takes little photo/video and shows on the other person's device, and vice versa.

nothing else. lovely.
