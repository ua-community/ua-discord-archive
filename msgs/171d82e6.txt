im looking for an open source web based notes solution that ideally supports some outliner features eg dragging a section/block to reorder, indent, click anywhere on the page to write instead of having to create empty new lines,  standard rich text, tags, co-editinng/collaboration. can also be more like an sdk if its high level enough to be not months of work to get something usable. could also just be vscode extension not standalone. i thought is saw something with a bit similar ux to leaflet a while ago but dont remmeber the name...
