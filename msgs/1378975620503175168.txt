BTW, here's  https://github.com/tileshq/mcp-cli - a dead-simple CLI client and library of MCP, wrapped on top of the MCP's official Typescript SDK. It's got adaptive HTTP/SSE transport and OAuth, which I believe covers all877764 existing remote MCP servers. The idea is to build a nice library that you can just import and use an MCP client in any kind of interfaces.
