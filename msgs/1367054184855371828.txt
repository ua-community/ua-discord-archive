My personal widget workflow:
- pipe stuff into a spreadsheet
- publish a particular sheet w/ the numbers i need
- put a JS script in an iCloud dir
- that JS script is loaded by Scriptable on iOS
- it fetch()es the sheet URL, load the csv data
- and publishes that data in widgets on my iOS homescreen
- and b/c it's in an iCloud dir, i can edit the script in vim locally
- so the dev workflow between desktop and mobile is nearly instant
