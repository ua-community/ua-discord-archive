Some thoughts for sensemaking stage that might be helpful:

- identifying capabilities we developed which don't exist in browsers
- identifying capabilities we developed which don't exist in the extension systems evaluated
- identifying where web and existing extension systems have points to be used for maximizing compat/interop to make integration easier (eg postMessage)
- handwavey thought about each project's approach to what's in core vs features-as-extensions vs 3rd-party extensions... seems different for each of the systems you looked at, and the projects people are building here in this community
