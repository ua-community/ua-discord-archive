wow really hard to get over the amp news. what does this mean for the ecosystem? we will have agents running in the cloud or as containers. no more cli or extensions. its unavoidable as agents need more sophisticated setup and clis and running in the ide plugins directly were a real obvious stop gap. agents will connect to a web ui to orchestrate.  so extensions will still be an obvious way to do that just they connect now to the agent with an api and version control primitives.
