The idea is that we don't need precision, we need high-enough confidence to detect the basic classes needed for web use-case recall, eg people, orgs, places, events. Once those are indexed, we can then get 1:n matching of entity:address, et voila: Peek becomes a personal abstraction of the real world as we perceive it though the web, aggregated and separate from the set of (disappearing, branded, hostilely surveilling, etc) URLs where we experienced it.
