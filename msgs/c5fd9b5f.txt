(user)  sounds totally in line with (user)  s posts so not sure why it would not fit in. personally i dont really like things that are build for ai vs just fixing the issues that existing generic protocols have eg. in this case i guess its we need urls to point to resources that are stateful and including execution contexts so cannot be described fully by their content hash but depending on online status they might need to be satisfied by a local compatible model or an online provided one?  what is the reall upside over proxying via local models that satisfy the requirements and could then decide much more fine grained what to fullfill locally?
