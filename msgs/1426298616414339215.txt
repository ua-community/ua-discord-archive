> Another core tenant of the web is accessibility

Mmm, interesting! Love to learn more about this. I do need to up my web accessibility game for sure.

> this particular path is a little bit of a "lost art".

Lets make it less lost! ðŸ™Œ I very much look forward to the day I can combine my experiments with the work y'all been doing at folkjs (and dialog db too (user))

> rooted in the DOM as an information substrate. A good intro video here.
> The DOM as a set of materials and instruments (that operate on other materials)

Great talk yeah. I think this also applies to my experiments that I explained earlier. Correct me if I'm wrong. Each web component, with as much config & info pushed to the DOM, being a material or instrument. All operating on, or connecting to, each other. The ability to take tools from separate origins and mix them in with the others.

ðŸ’¯

> While I don't usually pair signals custom elements

Yeah, I figure I could get everything to work with (custom) events instead, probably better but with more boilerplate. Signals might end up acting weird when removing/adding instances of web components. Experimenting to be done!

> I'd like to do some more technical writing about how these systems work

I'd like that too!
