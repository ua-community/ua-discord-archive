I really like the cybernetic thinking here. Reminds me of "Natural Born Cyborgs" which hypothesizes that being cyborgs define the human condition.. which informed my tongue and cheek but also serious thought that the knee of the "tech singularity" curve was hit the moment we started externalizing symbolic thinking through communication and estblishment of legible cultural norms. Chairs and writing. So the idea of llms creating external artifacts that can be interacted with by people and other llms.. there's a there there that's should be investigated more.
