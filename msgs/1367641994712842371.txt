A metaphor I've been thinking about is that the current web browser is a file cabinet. Each web page is a manila folder with the title of the web page written on the folder's tab. There's only enough room to pull out and view one or two folders at a time. There's no space outside of the folder to do anything. If you're lucky you can only reorder the folders. Browsing through a file cabinet invokes a deep passivity of interaction and ownership.
