For example, here I have html + css as we're used to, and an alternative approach that I think would scale in large app code bases better
```html
<button onclick=f() style={bg-color: red, color: white}>
    SUBSCRIBE
</button>
```
```xml
<event onclick=f()>
    <box color=red>
        <text color=white>
            SUBSCRIBE
        </text>
    </box>
</event>
```
