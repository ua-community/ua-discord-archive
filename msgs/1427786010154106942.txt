"Seamless integration with Web Apps

With many modern apps built in the cloud, the experience between Progressive Web Apps and native apps is merging. In Zorin OS 18, these apps can now co-exist as first-class citizens.

The newly built-in Web Apps tool lets you turn any website into a desktop app through an easily accessible interface. Your web apps will appear in the start menu and can be used just like native applications.
