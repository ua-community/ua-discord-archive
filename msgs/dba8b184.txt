Facing issue where bmc ssl certs have name mismatch. Even if you trust the certificate gobally chrome still displays the warning screen that you must click through once per session. Using chrome to access web dashboards works but its better to just have rust code access directly via https itself. I'll try to go this route and establish the vnc connection itself skipping all this chrome automation lark.
