"Sovereignty should not be the power to disconnect, but the capability to participate on one’s own terms—to govern technology through democratic principles of transparency, accountability, and rights. That capacity depends on interoperability: the ability to connect diverse systems, laws, and institutions without coercion or dependence.

This essay calls that principle interoperable sovereignty—a model where autonomy and cooperation are mutually reinforcing. It builds on the argument advanced in my previous essay The Case for Open Sovereignty in a Fragmenting Internet, which proposed open sovereignty as a framework for reconciling autonomy with interdependence: the ability to protect one’s values and institutions while remaining engaged in global systems." https://www.komaitis.org/write-share-ignite/interoperable-sovereignty-the-democratic-alternative-to-digital-authoritarianism?__cf_chl_tk=QfjPwCrfqSnk7PP3.pL9INgDtiTuoQCKg2sZl3HNetc-1761227465-1.0.1.1-W6imSPcXZz4LG4BsuUSHGcLexreJjUkkq95GbJOMzlY
