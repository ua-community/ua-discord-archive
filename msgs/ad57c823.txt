Hello! Info about this project:

## MIR
What is a machine intelligence resource (MIR)?
- Machine intelligence resources are artificial intelligence model weights, their parameter configurations, their code repositories, and the code commands that assemble those pieces.

What is a MIR universal resource information (URI) schema?
- The MIR URI schema is a structure to hyperlink machine intelligence resources.

What does MIR need to work?
- A nested structure that is readable by both humans and machines is required to store data under hyperlinks in MIR. There must then be a means to search and retrieve links and their data.

What is the difference between MIR and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?
- Model Context Protocol directs folks running AI models to networked servers to perform tasks.
- MIR directs folks to offline or online resources with or without servers to make AI models run at all.

What does MIR look like?
- MIR looks like a web URL in reverse that branches into instances of data or other MIR URIs. The URI itself looks like this:

## mir : // model . vit . clip-l : stable-diffusion-xl

`mir :  // model .    lora      .    hyper    :   flux1-dev`
` ↑         ↑          ↑               ↑              ↑`
[URI] : //[Domain].[Architecture].[Series]:[Compatibility]

End Goal:
- As a URI standard, it means room for MIR resolvers and *MIR browsers*. Can be used totally offline, its ultra simple and extensible, and can be implemented in countless ways.
