unfortunately s25 is now too new  😭  for hardware accel to work, drivers expected to come out in 2026, but even cpu only is enough to even play youtube videos and do everyday browsing. got window manager setup and audio support working too. screenshot is darc and native android app  (its not real compositing , eg. darc cannot go over the android app, but  to occasionally augment it with android apps its fine.)
