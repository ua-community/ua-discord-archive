A related question: Has anyone thought about CRDT granularity when the editors are LLM agents instead of humans? For example, Notion-style CRDTs operate at a character or block level for real-time human editing, but agents typically rewrite entire sections or whole documents in one step. Does that push us toward coarser, patch-based or transactional CRDTs instead of fine-grained ones?
