> I feel like philosophically at least, local first is about governance rather than performance per se

Ie this, I would agree with the statement. But other people might not.

If I only draw a rough line around everyone that uses the term local first the main things are
- better UX / performance
- data on device
- something something syncing

I think the people using it as a term for an agency / Governance idea are just one part that see the possibilities in that direction & care about them. Others may just care about building a great product.
