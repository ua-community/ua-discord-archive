for data thats a no brainer because you can verify. for functions i think its still active area of research for trusted computing. you cannot verify the function that runs on someones server is the fuction you submitted, you cannot sign the data without leaking your key. so you basically have to push the functions to the consumers as service worker like asset to run on their device. effectively rendering the setup into a cdn.      BUT i think founding a cloudlfare compatible entity that is trusted and runs as a Cooperative  is an absolute goal. this is a shape that also can naturally make money without misaligned incentives.
