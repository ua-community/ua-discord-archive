I don't believe there is a line where you think there is. I mostly lurk here and read what interesting things come out of this, so I'm probably not one of the enlightened ones. But to suggest that you live in a different world than me seems ridiculous.
And sure, this community may have a specific way to *talk* about it's ideas, but ideas in this direction are all over the place.

Drawing a line somewhere just creates an unnecessary grouping and shuts out innovation & ideas from people you don't consider "in".
