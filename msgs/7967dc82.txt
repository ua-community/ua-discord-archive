thank you again, (user)  for the pointer to webtop. im thinking what about making a controlled frame shim based on webtop instead of iframe, that has ipc to the controlled frame in a chromeless linux vm and so has 100% identical security and api (even more sec as there is a layer of container on top) this would also mean we could launch darc in any browser tab as sub brower same  as cloudflare browser. also this means we can do the native UI except the controlled frame on android and can run darc as PWA without having to do a custom IWA enabled android build for at least the initial mobile support. it also has the giant added benefit that we can run any linux app in darc.
