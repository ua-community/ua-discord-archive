I think it's disengenuous to say that rust isn't as fast as JS when this Rust being called from JS as a dependency. In this case there'd be a lot of overhead doing the FFS between rust/js so of course there'd be overhead compared to doing raw JS. I'm guessing their interface wasn't optimized to reduce FFI overhead just by looking at the JS API for v6. https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-6-better-performance-more-flexibility-and-type-safe-sql
