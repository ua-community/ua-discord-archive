Yeah, although it's encrypted and specific to a user, why would anyone touch that data, unless asked to do so by the user?
Not sure, I'm not very knowledgeable when it comes to these things, feels like I'm missing something.
Reading the BATs docs
> Raw blocks are the most sensitive (they hold users' encrypted data)
I wonder, why is this sensitive? In my mind encrypted = I'm happy to share this with anyone and everyone.
Similarly I don't really get why bats are necessary, if someone wants to store my data for free, why not?
