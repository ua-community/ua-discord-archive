My brain is a little overloaded when trying to bring in digital credentials work, and I can allow for the security need to be higher there. But man, it was really dismaying hearing some of those pretty strong stances that seem fairly broadly against custom schemas.

What's more frustrating is it feels like the custom schema issue would be much lower priority. If the browsers hadn't dropped `registerContentType`!!!! Which is very webby!
