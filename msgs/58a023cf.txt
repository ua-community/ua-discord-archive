I posted this a while back, but didn't really discuss the design. You can select/add/remove tags from anything - URLs, text, images. You can even save sets of tags as a record (more on this later). The tag sorting is based on frecency by default, but you can layer on scoring heuristics - eg for URLs I added per-domain scoring bump so that tags previously selected for the domain name of the URL you're saving will appear higher in the list.
