...I don't know what Doctorow's whole thing with testicles are, but he sure does talk about them a lot. So much so that I completely stopped paying attention to his article and did a quick search to see if it's a thing, It is. I kinda wish he'd stop. It's distracting. I won't be able to read his work without thinking about it now.

Anyhow, I pretty much agree with this take. I think Mozilla acted as a pretty great shield for them here. Every penny they've put into Mozilla justified. Not that Mozilla did anything wrong here, but I wish they'd been able to get out of Google's thumb for reals like 15 years ago.
