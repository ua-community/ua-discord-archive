I'm hoping that I can make it not server-first. But not totally clear how to approach that.

Strategy so far: every build of Diffuse becomes an artifact represented by a CID. You can load any artifact via any deployment of this combination of static site + redirect rules standard.

So far this is deployed on Netlify and IPFS. Both should allow for a "pick whatever version of the software you want" flow.

I suppose I should test this in Agregore or something by loading it with the ⁨`ipfs://`⁩ protocol ...

Can we do better?
