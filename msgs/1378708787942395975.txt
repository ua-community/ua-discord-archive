interesting. i wonder if there is a way for people to cooperate to earn money part time so that time is left for your own projects. i remember on hackernews jobs there was one company or cooperative that limits its employees/contributors to 10 hours a week. personally i could live on 2k per month. so an average dev salary part time would be enough. leaving time for my projects.
