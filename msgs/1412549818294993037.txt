tilekit or tiles wont have anything to do with agentic coding though, tilekit is gonna be a general git like CLI for model weights, took inspiration from: https://colinraffel.com/blog/a-call-to-build-models-like-we-build-open-source-software.html

and Tiles (built with Tilekit) strictly a memory network thing that's private (trains on your device or with TEEs on servers)
