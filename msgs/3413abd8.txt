At the Vulkan layer image buffer = memory location. So yeah, if you work at that level, it's just a pointer swap.
Copying is really really cheap on the GPU (the GPU can usually even just do aliasing at a hardware level).
The cost is more in resources available. Memory space to a degree, and most importantly memory bandwidth.
That's at least the perspective I've learned from games, CAD, etc.
Don't think that directly translates to desktop apps, though I'm not even sure what the challenge would be there 😅
