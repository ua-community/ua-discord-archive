Corps always find an excuse to purge people to devalue the job market overall. It's unclear to me if AI is actually a new phenomenon of automation or the latest excuse in 150 years of industrialist bullshit. I saw an article saying that people are being hired back at lower rates. AI isn't working out.. except it is, in the usual way.

Plenty to be mad about.
