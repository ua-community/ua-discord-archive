opus 4.5 is the first model regularly feeling like a colleague not an intern. it is able to do things i put on hold before because they felt just slightly out of reach. some forms of procrastination now become a virtue if models keep improving at this rate. : D it sometimes refuses to do a task that was not a good idea or recommends alternatives and on second thought it was always  right. for contributions it is now feasible to maintain a fork with complex changes  and have agents constantly rebase, something too involved before . i wonder what the impact on open source collaboration will be. i usually only go through the pain of getting something merged because maintaining a fork is more pain. also on the other side if an agent i trust can rebuild a pr to my standards why would i work with external contributors back and forth to merge their prs.
