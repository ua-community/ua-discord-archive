I spent days trying different launchers, and clipboard managers. I even picked one I thought was gonna be the one!

Then used it for a couple weeks then forgot. Then forgot which one I'd picked.

I still have my compfuzor automation for most of them, so I can go back and look, but lol, what a shame. Vicinae might be my jam anyways as I dig extensions.
