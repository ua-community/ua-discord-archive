Evaluation and AI context engines → Governance of cognition

The context-engine work extends these principles into the epistemic layer.
Automation must remain auditable.
Evaluation precedes delegation: systems expose their reasoning, provenance, and scope of consent before acting.

Connecting multiple AIs through MCP-style protocols becomes a rehearsal for mutual legibility—agents exchanging scope, provenance, and authority statements that humans can read and override.
It is governance enacted at the level of cognition itself.
A tool’s reasoning chain is treated as a civic artifact, subject to scrutiny and amendment.

Agency scales upward when the infrastructures of thought remain open to inspection and correction.

Structural patterns
Pattern    Purpose
Inversion    Redirect an extractive flow to produce insight and leverage.
Reversibility    Preserve the ability to withdraw, undo, or fork at every layer.
Cycle literacy    Expect re-centralization and design with feedback channels intact.
Evaluation before execution    Make inquiry the first operation of any automated process.
Relational sovereignty    Coordinate power through shared, bounded authority instead of isolated autonomy.
