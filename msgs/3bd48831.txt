Btw im still not over the amp video. They actually said they aspire to be more like openClaw and want to be more like an art installation than dependable software. You should not think about them as building your lego bricks but more like being on a rug that can be pulled away at any moment so you have to be forced to change how you work at any moment. this is so wild to me i dont even have words. its their actual words not exaggerated
