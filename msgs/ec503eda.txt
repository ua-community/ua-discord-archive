This is why these conversations always come back to re-thinking the origin security model. Too hard to think freely within that constraint. Tiles trades away capability A to get capability B. Aside from secure-origin-or-not, the web security model doesn't really operate that way. In the list of "connective glue" approaches we listed above, some anchor to origins, some are in browser (so, user) space. Need both, since I cannot ever fully assume a 3rd party will have the functionality I want or that it's DNS-based origin will always exist.
