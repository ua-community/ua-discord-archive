I used diagrams like this a lot for the years I did moz/dweb/p2p/ipfs/etc talks. I want the "me" to work first. Then the "me and you". The web went "global" first, and hasn't meaningfully achieved (yet) anything that works in the inner two rings. Beaker, IPFS and other things like that aimed for inner circles and outer circle (for varying trade-offs and levels of success/failure).
