ok i figured out why Discord screen sharing was not working for me, and it was a confluence of things:

- after migrating OS to new laptop, Discord did not re-ask for screen recording permission, i had to manually re-add it

- the "share entire screen" option is NOT DISPLAYED IN DISCORD! it's overlaid on the top-right corner of the *display*, so if you're usually on a laptop but are now on a large secondary display, you can miss it completely (or i can, anyway)

- on macOS, i could not get Discord to share a desktop that it was not on. i ended up just moving Discord to the desktop i wanted to share.
