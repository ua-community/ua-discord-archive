I want to work more with feynon on tiles/MIR, and I have a few new small-scale application ideas I might try. Currently I am doing a special re-implementation of [arXiv:2302.04222](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04222v6) because I think it will make the biggest difference for the most people in a short amount of time, and because I'm an artist so duh. I am thinking about how to restructure my software and os system for data redundancy and rapid-erase immutability in the post-mortem internet age. suggestions or feedback welcome as always
