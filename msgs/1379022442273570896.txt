In order to build a package manager that can install apps from github repos in similar way to how devs clone and run apps locally I think part of the xe puzzle is a way to spin up containers. This can be done in the web layer using webconainer.io similar to how bolt.new / bolt.diy works. This works for many simple vite apps using npm and pnpm but often fails for more complex apps. Another approch I looked at was using docker but this required root which I preferred not to use. So I ended up messing around with podman which feels like a good fit.
