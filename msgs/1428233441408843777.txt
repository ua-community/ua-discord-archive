This one's for (user) and anyone else who's tried to get Mozilla leadership to pay attention to user data. It's from Mark Surman's defunct personal blog in 2012. Check out my comment: https://web.archive.org/web/20230202071237/https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2012/04/03/scouting-movement-for-the-web/#comment-6542

The sheer number of times and number of people and number of ways I tried to get these convos into the org... and anytime I'd get traction with someone, they'd soon be out of the organization. (Which, not my fault. Mozilla's history is filled with the hiring of all the right people at the right times and then ignoring them.)

I think I'm finally over it. Mostly. Yeah.
