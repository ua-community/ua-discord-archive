I think local first is a pot of people from different views, that happen to like local data. I think that's a good thing, many people identified an overlapping interest, even though the motivation is different.
Of course that leads to tension when implementation comes around, but things are happening.
Linear proofed that local data can be the superior UX choice. Linear isn't 100% of what I'd like local first to be, but it's an entry point.

Similarly, react / GQL / Facebook stuff is a great way to get into local first. It's basically just a thing that enables easy caching, but it's one facade of local first.
And then maybe the user agency part resonates, or maybe the privacy part resonates, or the DX part, etc.

Us saying linear isn't local first is probably correct, but also just projecting the set of values we like onto this community/movement. And probably not even the same values from reader to reader in this chat 😅
