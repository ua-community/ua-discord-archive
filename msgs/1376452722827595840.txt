Just thought I'll briefly explain how everything works on tiles:

1. A list of MCP servers are fetched from https://mcp.run to the client side when the site is loaded. That's basically our registry. This allows the user to use '@' or use the 'show available servers' button to see what's available to use.

2.When the user mentions the MCP server (using @) and enters a prompt, selects the prompt, and click run Tiles, client side fetches the corresponding WASM code/module from mcp.run, and runs it in the agentic loop.
