Just spotted (user) in the wild while researching this, so maybe someone else also has an opinion.
What about privacy focused apps + IPFS - I want all user data to be encrypted, but I also want natural data deduplication and such. Seems like IPFS doesn't really provide a great solution here.
The hypercore solution with an extra indirection is nice, but doesn't actually seem like it solves privacy, the data is out in the open, just not immediately obvious.
