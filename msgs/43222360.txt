While working on a browser extension to import+push all history, tabs, groups, bookmarks into Peek, I found an actual compat issue where Firefox and Chrome differ: When implementing Chrome's `browser.history.search`, Firefox chose to not mimic Chrome's "pass 0 to get all history" (discussion at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1265834). There's no bug on either side I could find tracking the incompatibility.
