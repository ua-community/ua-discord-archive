The coarse notion that LLMs raise the floor on software creation elides an important economic relationship to me.

LLMs lower the entry price for software to be created on one's behalf by someone. But, the actor who pays and the actor who creates are different actors.

This is meaningfully different from a contrived fantasy world where we could raise the floor by uploading programming knowledge into an actors brain.

It's even different from a contrived world where computers are intrinsically much easier to program.
