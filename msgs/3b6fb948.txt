That isn't to say that we haven't made any progress on the front. I'm constantly in awe of the web's potential to realize such a vision. The URL as a freely addressable surface for a web page and it's source code is a major reason (although I don't want to discount other principles of the web like the user agent or law of least power)  that "view source" is a thing at all, in a time where the idea you can see source code of an application that you're paying for is sort of an absurd thought.
