From one of Gordon’s article:

“Some answers will vary from project-to-project, but I see some common patterns:

Immutable data
Universal identifiers
User-controlled keys
If you have all three, you have a fair shot at building first, decentralizing later”

So I was wondering what a pragmatic decentralised solution would look for tiles registry which will host Modelfiles and machines metadata, how should I tie them with user identities
