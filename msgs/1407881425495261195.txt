I don't know if elsewhere Google maps does more, I've seen cool public transport features in some cities and such, but here (Southern Germany) the data quality is horrible.
From public transport that teleports, to impossible connections, not usable imo.
Driving may be better, but I don't use that.
Bike isn't great either.

So yeah, I use a non-maps app for transit information, but it doesn't even have a map in the first place so I'd probably use it regardless.
