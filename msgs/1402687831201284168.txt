Yeah, I get that. I just don't see how the economics make sense. The proposed scenario as I understand what I'm reading here:

1. Spend billions on research and training to produce the model (a commodity artifact)
2. Release the unencumbered weights for free
3. ???
4. Make it up selling a device that facilitates inference (perhaps only for the vendor's model?)

What doesn't make sense to me:

- If the hardware is constrained so that it only supports the vendor's models, that seems to be the same as the OpenAI play: users effectively are not able to choose their model
- Model choice only matters if there are models to choose from; hardware play seems like it would favor vertical integration (at least for the foreseeable future); how will all the alternatives make money?
- If the hardware is open-ended (in the sense that it preserves user choice of models), great! But, that implies that the hardware is also a commodity. Where is the economic return going to come from?
