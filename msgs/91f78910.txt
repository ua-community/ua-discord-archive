i think thats the domain of AGI, but yeah certain set of software makes sense vibe coded, the replacement is at higher level of stack, rn I can code whole Tiles frontend without knowing much of frontend, thanks to v0 and Cursor, I didnt had to hire anyone, just 40 bucks a month, so in that way something did got replaced, or at least something I wouldnt be able to do myself became possible, so its rather I got empowered, these usecases are not competing with existing ones, but with new ones
