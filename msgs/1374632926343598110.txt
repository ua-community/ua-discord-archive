Today I could make the case that purely on economic grounds distribution on the web seems feasible (mostly thanks to the greed of the app store gatekeepers).

That said, I grant you that there is hard work involved to truly meet the potential of nerwork-wide distribution on the web. I don't claim that it is easy, I only claim that it is possible.
