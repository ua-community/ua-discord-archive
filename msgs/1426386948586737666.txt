Agency, drawn from the writing itself

Agency emerges here as the capacity to set terms, delegate power, and revoke it, individually or together, under conditions that remain legible, consentful, and reversible.
It’s enacted, not granted; a quality of infrastructure design rather than moral appeal.

Three elements recur and build on one another:

Legibility – seeing what a system is doing, by whom, and with what consequences.

Negotiability – altering those conditions through rule-making, delegation, or withdrawal.

Collective scope – extending those same capabilities to groups that share authority intentionally.

Every major thread in your messages elaborates one or more of these dimensions.

Composability and the Webmaker lineage → Legibility

The Webmaker reflections show a long preoccupation with visible wiring.
Composability for non-coders is about being able to trace cause and effect through interfaces.
API discoverability, widget manifests, OAuth-into-browser, CRDTs, ocaps—all serve the same end:
users can follow the flow of capability, understand its scope, and recombine it safely.

CRDTs handle simultaneous edits without conflict; ocaps restrict access by task instead of identity.
Together they model structured transparency: collaboration that exposes structure without leaking control.

Legibility here means a continuous ability to perceive and adjust the relationships that govern use.

Browsers, sync, and shared profiles → Collective scope

The browser is treated as a coordination layer where capability, memory, and identity meet.
You ask what happens when a sync profile is shared—bookmarks, extensions, permissions, histories.
The experiment sketches governance at the smallest social scale:
how authority circulates between members of a shared context,
how accountability and consent are logged and revisable.
