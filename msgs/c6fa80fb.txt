its kind of crazy i think it would mean effectively publishing your ssl private key and the signed code. then everyone who is admitted into the hosting group would get the code including the key, join the anycast group. the anycast routing layer verifies that the perticipant runs the trussted code and kicks out any bad actors. the clients need to run an additional step not just verifying the ssl signature but also the attestation part that verifies the code is the published one. i am not 100% sure this would need to be an extension or works with browsers as is
