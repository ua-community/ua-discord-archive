I get what you're saying, but I think that local-first is a little different of a situation. Local-first was defined by the idea "You own your data, in spite of the cloud". And I think it's conflation with sync engines (like the confusion we see above), and the meaning of movement create new type of cloud with the same (bad) power dynamics playing out as we see with the current cloud.
