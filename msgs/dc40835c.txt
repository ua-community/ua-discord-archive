OpenCollective as a nonprofit actually closed a couple years ago. Open Source Collective (OSC) which uses the Open Collective platform is alive though. I think OSC mainly only offers the baseline fiscal sponsorship, managing the funds, taxes, etc. I'm wondering who else is around who might offer more in addition. The previous nonprofit I worked with was fiscally sponsored and the sponsor offered the entire legal and admin stack for having employees.
