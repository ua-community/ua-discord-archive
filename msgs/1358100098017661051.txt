(cw: crypto, cont'd) another flavor of that approach is a DAF that stakes donations, and pipes the interest to the target entity. this is more hybrid trad-fi/crypto angle and includes the explicit non-profit aspect, which is a tricky wrinkle. i went a bit of a ways down this road and got blocked by the requirements for being a DAF administering org, oof., no thanks. Endaoment seems to be enabling this as a service now though, so might just be possible off-the-shelf soon.
