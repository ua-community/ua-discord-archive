Yes, although I'm on the "many apps and standards" side instead of the mega app side.
I really like how kagi maps has just the search, and then encourages links outside. Choice, privacy, scope creep, etc, not a problem.
If only the OS was a little better. Right now I press "Geo" and then it links into the OS, and I choose one of the apps that do different things.
Can't easily save a location or share it from there though, for example.
