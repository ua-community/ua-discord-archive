One of the things Ive been thinking about in regards to the collage metaphor is that you have to own a copy of a magazine/book/etc in order to be able to collage it. Like you cant collage something that your lending from the library. And the web works in a library lending kind of way. The browser might have dowloaded a copy of a web page, but that download isn't your. You cant edit it, cut it up, throw parts away because you can persist change to it.
