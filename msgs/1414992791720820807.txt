Yeah sorry, didn't realise that was a term used elsewhere as well ðŸ˜… 

Use case:
Domain A consumes a "component" by using a web page through an iframe from domain B.
So for example, a component that provides data to domain A.
When loading that page through the iframe, it would have no user interface, only a postMessage interface through which the data could be retrieved.
However.. if you would load that page from domain B on its own, outside the iframe, you would get a configuration interface. There you can configure how the data should be fetched.

With state partitioning enabled, this doesn't work, because the configuration made outside the iframe is not available inside the iframe. I know I can use those storage-access apis to resolve that, but that api feels like a hot mess.
