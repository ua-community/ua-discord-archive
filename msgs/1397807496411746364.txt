Quick ask for this group: I'm putting together this event in NYC in August, all about the future of the web (along with some colleagues in the AI/protocols/web publishing space).

We're still looking for a speaker to talk about MCP, in particular how someone might publish information to the agentic web via MCP (instead of a traditional web page). We've had some pretty cool people sign up â€“ WaPo, ProPublica, Cloudflare, Mozilla, and Free our Feeds.

Would anyone be interested/know someone who might be knowledgeable on this topic? Also if anyone from this group happens to be in NYC on the 20th of August you should totally come join!
