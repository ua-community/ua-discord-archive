Figured can stay keyless way with Sigstore approach and still honor
"user-owned keys" at setup by binding a user's long-lived key to their Sigstore identity once, then accepting keyless signatures from that identity thereafter.

Can even do a Keybase like provision workflow where one device provisions other where device keys are all tied to a single identity
