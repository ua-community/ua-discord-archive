The approach I’m taking with setup is to connect the folknet operator agent to all the servers via the management switch and then have it build out a set of cli tools in rust to manage everything. Essentially it’s ai agent connected to everything via one lan cable. So far it can interface with the microtik switch, discover all servers, access servers via BMC and IPMI, handle power management, toggle things like boot on power settings, etc. 

It’s able to access the BMC web interface using browser but has issues accessing the kvm mostly due to fact the launch button typically opens a popup and Claude chrome plugin only works on tabs. The fix is to mod the page before clicking the button to add a new button to open in a tab instead. This got me as far as the console but next I need to get it to do the keyboard del key to get into bios. Once in the bios should be possible to turn on console redirection to serial and then read that via IPMI instead of having to use the web kvm which is slow for agent. Assuming that works I should have bios access / console access directly and can do the next step. Mounting installer images via BMC and running terminal based install. Or perhaps going NetBoot PXE route.

If I fail to get this web kvm / serial console stuff working in next few hours I’ll just give up and do it manually, but goal is to never do anything other than physical plugging in cables and hardware and have the agent do everything over the management network itself.
