i am trying to fund myself through remote software dev and sysadmin consulting. but it's hard because i don't have a good network to get projects, or jobs. the hardest though is that when i am busy chasing work then i can't focus on my own project. being single with children doesn't help. with all my savings gone i also can't afford to travel to conferences where i could make new contacts.
