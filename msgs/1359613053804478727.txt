ya surely related! But I think Alex's essays focus on UX degradation of React (bundle size, loading times, data/rendering waterfalls, poor accessibility etc.). Particularly it's effect on mobile and public sector web pages. 

I'm more interested in how the emergents below have affects agency, malleability, and openness on the web:
- it's sovereignty over the web page is in tension the DOM as a multiplayer substrate
  - web extensions breaking hydration
- abstracting away the web
  - obfuscation of view source (divintitis and hashed CSS names)
  - the entire representation of the app is hidden away in JS
  - entirely new approaches needs to be create for stuff the web already handles (e.g. CSS-in-JS)
- both it's functional ethos and the tooling it requires increases technical gatekeeping to make things on the web
