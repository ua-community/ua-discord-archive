it's already what Peek does when registered as default handler for HTTP URLs - open in a single undecorated window. but i hadn't thought about doing *only* that, without any of the rest of Peek's functionality. and that it'd be a tiny code change for Singular (and the name kinda works too). so thank you for the idea!
