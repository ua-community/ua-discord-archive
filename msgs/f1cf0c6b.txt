the prototype will be published eventually will add it to darc just to start in the background and slowly start using it for some data to get experience. the official builds are pretty good now, i dont see a reason to use one of these other releases now. just need write the right boilerplate to start it. (400 lines of code or so)  no experience with drizzle, with kysely it worked fine but will not add orm now, seems to much. trying out typeguards with arktype instead
