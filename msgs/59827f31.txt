Tech giants treat your digital
            life as a raw material to be extracted, refined, and sold to the
            highest bidder. They pretend to give you control to appease
            regulators. In reality they go out of their way to cripple access
            and make every step as painful as possible. Partly to keep you locked-in, partly to hide how much they know, partly to keep you in a consumer mindset or just because it makes them no profit. Companies hide behind
            false flags of security and privacy to justify taking more and more
            of your control.
