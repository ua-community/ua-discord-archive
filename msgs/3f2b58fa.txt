after two days trying continue exclusively i have to amend: while its true that opus can fill in lots of bumps. the ui is still really rough, lots of missing features and things that are just annoying. plus opus in api pay per use is actually more expensive than amp that uses cheaper models for some things , so there is currently no reason to use continue over amp. plus kilo code is also open source and might be better to contrubute to than continue. continue misses tons of features and has glitches kilo has too many features and not so clean ui it might be more fruitful to make kilo better than add stuff missing
