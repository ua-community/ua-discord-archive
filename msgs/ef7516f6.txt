Hey y'all! I have a hopefully not hypothetical question.

Let's say I were to get some funding and/or find myself employed to do some network + community organizing and offer services such as meeting and strategy facilitation, project management, event planning and such, and I was to have included this community as one of the key ones in my pitch, what capacities and activities would you be interested in my bringing into this group? Without any additional context, any preliminary thoughts?

FYI, neither has happened yet, but I am putting together a work plan for the next 6 months to pitch to some people.
