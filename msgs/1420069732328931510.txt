Mitchel is an absolute beast, I followed ghostty development from the start, and he does an incredibly impressive job across leading the project, rallying a community, working with the Zig core people, creating the app & code, and is very friendly at that. He also casually dumps out very high-quality libraries on the side.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, he was one of the founders of hashicorp, and from my understanding basically created both terraform and later vault.
Now he has basically unlimited time & resources. Still, I find his work very impressive beyond that.
