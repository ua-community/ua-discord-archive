After a week with linux and android i am really feeling the difference between a merely open (source) system and real malleable software.  malleable software has to be able to change just the module i want to change and make the change on the highest level of abstraction that is reasonable plus ideally while using it. i guess it hurts more here because it feels like this should be open and possible but it usually just is not feasible.  plus the ux is so bad compared to macOS that i want to change something about every other click.  thinking about what  (user)  said about emac-lisp and the mealleable refuge.
