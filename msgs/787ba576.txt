Oops, haven't been updating here... pre-holidays, i worked on various things in Peek:
- added Tinybase (Sqlite-backed) as a datastore
- storing addresses, visits, blobs, documents, tags
- ripped out the placeholder settings ui and replaced with new placeholder settings ui
- fixed profile mix-ups
- page view history autocompletes in command bar
