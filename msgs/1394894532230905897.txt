I'm definitely in awe of Excel, the malleable system to beat. But the lack of version control is notable. Much less capturing intent! The way that intra-action writing markdown files ad-absurdum captures/clarifies intent is a powerful improvement that this AI era is bringing the software-development lifecycle, records history & intent so much better than so much of how dev has been done before.
