This experiment I'm doing is like "There's a group of people hanging out, and one person paid another person to make empanadas, that anyone who happens to be around can eat. The whole group didn't need to decide whether it was ok for that to happen, what the food is, how much it cost, when it is served, etc. The person who paid gets to eat the empanadas they paid for, the chef gets some income (and probably tertiary benefits too, like empanadas and now the community knows they are good making empanadas), some other people happen to get empanadas and are stoked, some people weren't around and missed out, some people don't like empanadas anyway".
