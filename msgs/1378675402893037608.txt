i agree with that though, if i am working with components then that is what i want. just had to fight this yesterday. a component with an ID, but since IDs need to be unique across the whole page, i am forced to include some outside context. same goes for tabbing order. even more so. i needed to define the tabbing order within a component. regardless of the tabbing order outside. can't be done. it needs to be global
