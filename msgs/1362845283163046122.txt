HAPPY FRIDAY EVERYONE!!! A couple of fun things to share:

- We were accepted by Open Collective Europe, so can accept donations. Donations will go to Discord and bot hosting and the costs of in-person events, and perhaps in the future things like community stewarding or research fellowships or {your ideas here}. Open Collective is up and running now: https://opencollective.com/user-and-agents

- Are you going to Local-first Conf in Berlin?? STAY A BIT LONGER! We're hosting two days of casual unstructured time for coding/chatting/hanging together for the two days following Local-First Conf! Sign up here: https://lu.ma/v457jxp2
