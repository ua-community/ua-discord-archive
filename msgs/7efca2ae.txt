i feel like glasses are going in right direction by themselves. 3 + companies, res, fov, DoF, camperas, sensors all going up. with android getting xr and desktop support as well as linux vms, that side seems solved soon, also solving hardware because now any decent phone will do. whats still absolutely missing for me is a decent input device. if we use this for real work not for some gimmick, hand gestures and voice alone will not do it.
