How about ecosystem research, resource gathering, and outside stakeholder engagement? Are there other ecosystems that would be interesting to dialogue with to share knowledge, get feedback, cross-pollinate, and invite in? Either at this stage of r&d or later after launches or publications y'all have in mind?
