"ABSTRACT
Today’s algorithm-driven interfaces, from recommendation feeds
to GenAI tools, often prioritize engagement and efficiency at the
expense of user agency. As systems take on more decision-making,
users have less control over what they see and how meaning or re-
lationships between content are constructed. This paper introduces
"Hypertextual Friction," a conceptual design stance that repositions
classical hypertext principles—friction, traceability, and structure—
as actionable values for reclaiming agency in algorithmically medi-
ated environments. Through a comparative analysis of real-world
interfaces—Wikipedia vs. Instagram Explore, and Are.na vs. GenAI
image tools—we examine how different systems structure user ex-
perience, navigation, and authorship. We show that hypertext sys-
tems emphasize provenance, associative thinking, and user-driven
meaning-making, while algorithmic systems tend to obscure pro-
cess and flatten participation. We contribute: (1) a comparative
analysis of how interface structures shape agency in user-driven
versus agent-driven systems, and (2) a conceptual stance that offers
hypertextual values as design commitments for reclaiming agency
