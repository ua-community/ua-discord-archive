(I was on Core but, loved both. I hung out w/ Aza's team and still talk w/ some of those folks today. I ended up an ally of Labs in Core, getting things like TabCandy crash-landed in the tree, so was considered a traitor by some in Core (who never let me forget it either). Also ended up being considered a no-fun cockblocker by some in Labs because i didn't give blanket support to their "let's automatically log users into websites" idea and said they should try making a spec and tests etc to win over Core and they were like "nah".)
