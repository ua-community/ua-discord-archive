Is there a "browser" out there that allows you to load web pages through os-level windows which you can move around? I'd like to load web pages in separate windows and still have them talk to each other like tabs in a regular browser (eg. over a broadcast channel)

It sounds like Peek allows you to do this, minus the ability to move them around with your cursor. Though tbh, I can't get Peek to work on my linux machine ðŸ˜… (keyboard shortcuts aren't triggering)
