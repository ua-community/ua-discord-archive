Currently wireframing some stuff, and I'm wondering whether there's good examples of inline resources being returned by chats.
Ie "I've created <file link> for you" and that link showing up with rich context.
Quite similar to the way the user provides context "objects" to the agent, the agent could return these? Not sure I've seen a good ui for that so far
