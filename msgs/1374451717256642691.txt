That's one thing I wanna mess with in Agregore-Mobile this year. Desktop has an LLM API that I added which uses local models, and I've been working on a tool to one shot generate + publish p2p web apps. I'm hoping to optimize the prompts for the generator and bring something like Qwen2.5-coder:7b onto mobile so I can get fully offline p2p web app creation + publishing on phones :P
