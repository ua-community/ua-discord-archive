They said they'll share them, will drop the link back here. Was a small group and mostly introductory, so nothing deep in the weeds. I was only around for first half, since was late my time. We broke out into two groups for first half - "what comes after browsers" and "web browser sustainability". The other topics listed were security/privacy, "are we stuck with js" and some other interesting things, so I'm interested also in the notes from the other sessions. The combo of Giorgio and the Tor folks alone I'm sure made any security conversation interesting.
