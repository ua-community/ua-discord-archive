Hmmm nothing that fits all of those. I'm enjoying having all my keyboard buttons on one hand and the trackpad is "ok" for mouse control. Gyro controls would need to be a separate device and there's some smart rings I've been eyeing to fill that niche if my trackpad ends up not being good enough. For microphone I'm using my bone conducting headphones or the built in mic in my xr glasses. I also just ordered a SenseCAP Watcher to use for camera and mic when I'm out and about as an interface for my local LLM setup
