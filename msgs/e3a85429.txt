On lineage having issues with STRONG Play Integrity check, tried those magisk/zip fixes etc to no avail for banking apps. Meanwhile the integrity situation is better on Graphene but still doesn’t pass STRONG checks. Also issues with downloading certain first party Google apps as they’ve a play store/services sandbox. Couldn’t get RCS working. Otherwise great built in privacy package. But feel very stock vanilla UI wise.
