Amp is so so so good at capturing the durable stream of what you do. I've heard a couple people be excited for this tonight in the opencode discord, and i love love love to hear that excitement. But opencode's backlog is limited, stuff rolls out, and it's not that easy to refer to or share or use. It's there but you ahve to go fish.

Amp just tackles this like a total fucking boss, absolutely fucking gem of a system. With incredibly good sharing, so you can just refer to other threads. It's absurdly good.
