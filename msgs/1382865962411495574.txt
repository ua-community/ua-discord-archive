this is a super interesting question. There isn't really one tag that I can think of that captures things. e.g. some things that people care about might be called #localfirst or #dweb .... "user agency" hasn't caught on as a tag (but is implied by dweb). #malleablesoftware is about the closest to something that very much aligns with THIS space
