RE readable, I could do that, but went with CBOR encoding for this method (DRISL default)
I could do a regular JSON version as well I suppose.
But there will be an export data button that gives you a json file, so <a:jake_shrug:1060243120568156160> 

DRISL was good here because it's deterministic, so I'm always getting the same CID back for the same JS object. No weird encoding bs.

Then based on those CIDs I'm keeping track of what got deleted/added/modified.
