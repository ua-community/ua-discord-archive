Hyperdrive has the benefit of needing to do *way less* work for content discovery / advertising. Their networking stack and replication protocol is a lot more tight. Only peers with stable IP become DHT nodes, hole punching is first class over DHT nodes, advertising is done just for the top level drive you're searching, and data is quickly fetched by passing bitfields around and an extension for being able to query B+ tree ranges without needing to traverse the DAG one network RTT at a time
