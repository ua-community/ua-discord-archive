My wife does human rights work, specifically focusing on bottom-up community/worker designed and driven movements. A lot of the challenges in effective collective action have to do with agency-less individuals. It's not either/or. Need both. Positive feedback loops. I focus on giving individuals more control b/c I believe it's the foundation for more effective collective action. That's the positive feedback loop.
