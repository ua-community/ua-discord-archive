continue has massively improved and is apache 2 i get really great results with opus 4.5 the model is just so good it can gloss over optimizations that amp does that now matter less. agent tools becoming less important with models improving. only bug in darc is no output of terminal run output. if i keep using it more i would have to fix that. but its quite exciting there might be an open source option that is usable and that we can improve to our needs
