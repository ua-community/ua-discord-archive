Certainly. It's well noted, and generally considered a feature not a bug. The history of Interop, Baseline, Web Features projects are all around the idea that the "emergent" web platform is biased towards vendor business interests, groupthink and even specific individual developers/standardistas. Those projects aim to shape the platform so that it aligns more closely to developer (thus business) signal, via the collection of input tools, eg MDN DNA, State of * surveys, Interop selection process, etc. A lot of this happened b/c Google acknowledges this tension and invests in trying to make the "emergent" aspect lean towards real designer/developer input.
