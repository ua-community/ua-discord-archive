Current state is most everything is plugged in and cabled up but needs OS installed on nodes and things like proxmox setup. Most of the nodes have BMC access or if not jetkvm accessible via a management network running on microtek crs326. I can access via tailscale to a mac mini thats also connected to that management network. I'm thinking of using claude code to speed up setup and management as well as document as we go.
