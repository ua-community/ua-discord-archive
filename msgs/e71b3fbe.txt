I also made an iOS app for quickly moving addresses (and soon more) into self-owned datastore, and off device. It's basic, but along the same design philosophy of Peek desktop, has a focus on instantaneity + assurance. In this case, that means three things:

- save anything (rn just addresses tho)
- quickly classify it
- get it somewhere "safe"
