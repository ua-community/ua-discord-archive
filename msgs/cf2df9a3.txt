(user)  there will be a built image hopefully not too far in future but currently its still a 10 minute process or so. Oh wow that means you got it running yourself and managed to add a clipboard manager? Let me know if you need help with anything or are stuck. I can also quickly help you get thigs running properly if you did not set up fully...
