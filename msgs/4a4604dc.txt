> There's something here regarding how to construct... software.. I guess we could call it? How does one shape a lego brick to enable proper assembly of the envisioned output; yet at the same time, allow for (optimal) alternative constructions (assemblies the lego brick creator did not think about, or could not imagine). - (user) 

I think that the vision behind [information substrates](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ntaudUum06E) could be helpful here! It's the idea that software has materiality and instrumentality. Historically closed applications like photoshop, CAD software, and video editing software are each isolated, domain-specific information substrates. In photoshop, pixels/the canvas/layers are the material one builds with and there is a whole slew of instruments that can act upon and modify that material. The systems are closed in the sense that they really don't allow new forms of instrumentality to be add.

Unix is probably the most general information substrate we've seen. Text/files/folders are the material upon which instruments in the CLI operate on. Shell scripts let you compose together existing material and instruments to make new instruments! One principle of information substrates that is apparent in UNIX, but not so much in closed apps is the fact that material (i.e. the file system) is freely addressable, which is defined as:

> Free addressability embraces transparent, publicly addressable state through queries, selectors, names, or other mechanisms that make parts of a running system targetable from the outside without requiring permission or coordination from the original creators, seeking to "maximally advertise the structure of the application via a transparent addressing scheme" ([source](https://folkjs.org/live-2025/#free-addressability))
