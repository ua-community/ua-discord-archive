the one where they announced amp shutdown i think it was shared in the links channel. its worth watching. it sounds at first glance not that outrageous but if you let sink in (no pun intended) its completely nuts. (user)  you probably cannot comment but as this is technically a different company now, is this collective AI psychosis on a hole company?
