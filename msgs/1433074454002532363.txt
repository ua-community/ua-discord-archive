great proposal.

i couldnt make it to the meeting but would like to add looking at these aspects in the research and requirements phase:

- looking at cloudflare managed component api developed to extend websites at the edge with limited impact, its rough but the best aligned system to darc architecture needs i could find.
-  (?) brief summarizing of the relevant parts from capabilities, ios and android permission system. going too deep in permissions is too much but a rough idea about these requirements might help asking the right questions
- short summary of successful plugin/ extension systems , i know there are plenty of super successful ecosystems out there , but i have no idea how they work or how much overlap with our needs they might have or not
