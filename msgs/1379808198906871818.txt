Summary
Recent Firefox (2024-2025): The -chrome flag and custom XUL browser interfaces are effectively dead. Mozilla has locked down the browser for security and maintainability. Your options are limited to:

CSS styling (userChrome.css)
Minor JavaScript modifications (with loaders)
WebExtensions (very limited)
Building Firefox from source
Using alternative browsers that maintain XUL support

For true browser UI customization, you'll need to either use a Firefox fork that maintains legacy support or build your own browser using Electron/Chromium Embedded Framework.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
