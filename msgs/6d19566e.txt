Yeah quiet is cool. I think thr main issue with tor is just bootstrapping and setting up connections. The other bit is I don't think they had sparse replication so they needed to sync their entire oplog before the app was usable which makes the main rooms rly hard to join. A side effect of using orbitdb I guess? I was trying to convince them of making a sparsely replicated alternative but I get why they do things the way they do.
