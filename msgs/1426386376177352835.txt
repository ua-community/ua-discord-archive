I put all my messages to this discord server into chatgpt for analysis. I think y'all might be interested in what came out. Ill put it all into a thread, but I really like the definition of agency it thinks I'm circling around: "Agency is the ongoing ability to perceive, modify, and revoke the systems that act through you—individually or collectively—within conditions of legibility, negotiability, and reversibility."
