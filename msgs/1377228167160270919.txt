> The important thing to realize is that AI is just that - AI. Artificial intelligence. A compute-based form of thinking, reasoning, deduction, execution.

Does not sit right with me. AI, as we know it, has nothing to do with intelligence, in my opinion. Even with the very latest state of the art models, I find AI to still be a misnomer.
