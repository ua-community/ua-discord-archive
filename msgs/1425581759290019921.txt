i wasn't speaking to Tabstack specifically, but i see it all the time and i used to be excited and now my reaction is not excited because it symbolizes a lot of negative outcomes (i listed some). it often means not open source (not always of course). often it goes beyond being just "not mine", in my experience it also means "i can't form it into what i need". add on take-away-ability, and i'm not super interested. maybe it's for other people, as Boris said, and that's great if whatever it is meets their needs!
