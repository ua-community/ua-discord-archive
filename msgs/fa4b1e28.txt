(user)  have been thinking about some of your ideas for a clipboard manager. not 100% sure how this would fit into the darc UI, but thinking about what it would mean if clipboard was a stack on top of the stage manger that had one entry per clipboad and unless pinned, the entries would disappear on using / pasting.  also you can drag and drop anythign to and from that staack instead of copy pasting, which feels much better on touch devices like large ipad.
