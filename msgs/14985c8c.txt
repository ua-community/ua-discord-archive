(user) thanks for the explanations, you are right from your perspective i am thinking about a limited notion of user agency right now. the timeline for xenon i have in mind: darc is a focused browser to make a vivaldi and arc replacement on xenon which is just the launcher on top of iwa at that the moment. at the same time keep refactoring the svelte/web components into modules that  feel right and factor out the features into xenons sdk layer and using the extension api we come up here as much as possible. then use those primitives to make something that a user can understand and reason about because it has the right/ logical abstractions and so can have full agency over.
