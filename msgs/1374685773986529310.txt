we were rappin on...
- multi-browser usage and feature-specific browser routing
- tinybase vs electricsql
- seeing automerge mentioned everywhere but not seeing it used?!
- OS level integration of browsers (eg Windows integration of IE was great direction, monopolizer behavior aside)
- ephemeral web pages at OS level (nobrowser) vs web app "install" (eg Nativefier) in Singular
- blur your eyes and the Local First schedule looks like "sync sync  sync sync"
- app-specific sync protocols vs interop and utility layer convergence
- app data archiving is also f'd, can't save your stuff in a reasonable way
- DHH's latest interest in small powerful computers
- the hw has arrived, but the sw for orchestration, coordination, "one click"-ness is still so far away
- AMD and ROC
- cloud vs local vs both
- icloud does the isomorphic bit nicely
