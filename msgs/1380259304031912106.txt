I'm developing a vision for local first a business model. The current paradigm is we subscribe to apps with money or watching ads, which then pay for cloud infrastructure. My vision is the user pays for cloud infrastructure themselves, and then purchases or otherwise acquires apps to run on it. Then, instead of people having several subscriptions for different apps, they just have one for their local cloud infrastructure. It would be similar to how we have one power bill that works for all the appliances we can buy.
