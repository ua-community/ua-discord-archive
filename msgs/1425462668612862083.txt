Hey Chris! Curious to hear more about this as I try to figure this out. Do you have any links to articles related to this?

I'm in this weird liminal space/state where I've moved on from regular web apps and tech like react, to a malleable software world ðŸ˜… I experimented with web applets and found some shortcomings, and more positively, overlap with web components.

The similarities between web applets and web components are interesting, but kind of obvious given that they both build on the same web platform foundations.

Anyhow, like holobrine, I too wonder how to build complex software on the web, whilst leaning into the web platform. I guess a big part missing here is good education/information on what exactly is all part of the web platform and what the philosophy is.

I do like the web platform, but feel like server rendering is a big part of that; and that thinking is somewhat incompatible with local-first software & data. We use a lot of JS here to provide the data and therefor no server rendering. We can still benefit a ton from using custom elements / web components though.

The solution I've come up with so far goes as follows:
* Both logic and UI lives in web components that are configurable via attributes.
* When complex data input or output is needed, these are provided via signals. Gives us automatic dependency tracking, memoization, etc.
* I could also work with events instead of signals (though for data I prefer the latter)
