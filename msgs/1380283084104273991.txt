I recently went to a family reunion and someone there had suspicions of big tech recording how you face reacts to things and learning to read your emotions. I don't think anything is doing that exactly, but it speaks to the vague uninformed suspicions most people have. I think most people intuitively sense that something feels off, but they don't know why.
