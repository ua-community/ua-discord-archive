I think we def have a user agency unlock if we can have this kind of expreince between the walled gardens most users live in, so user agents that can trasfer and understand each other's personal data stores etc (PDS), orgs like https://dtinit.org/ are leading the way in this direction, used their tool personally to switch from android to iPhone, I feel good that it's as seamless now and feel less suffocated using Apple devices
