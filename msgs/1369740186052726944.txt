IMO to get the cheapest large scale storage you can do this:

* S3 bucket where the ID is the root CID of your file
* Application defines chunking for UnixFS to what makes sense for it
* When you upload a file, generate a CAR file for it and store it in S3
* Keep a map of "human name"->CID->s3
* Optionally cache frequently used CIDs to your local blockstore (not a car, just one of the defaults)
