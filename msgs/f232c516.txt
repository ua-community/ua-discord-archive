Actually needs os install setup first but yeah I think a U&A tailnet makes sense for access. Perhaps a sub channel for keeping track of who is doing what. There are 3-4 gpu boxes so people could try stuff out on smaller one and then move up to the larger one. To figure out if we go with shared bare metal os or use proxmox and then people can have their own vm that gets spun up and down. Would allow for more custom configs and less chance of messing up things.
