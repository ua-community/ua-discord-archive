The interesting parts to me were little interaction design bits that no major browser is doing anything remotely like:

- Contextually-anchored micro command entry ("cursor chat"). Context-anchored interactions are a wobbly UX since always, so it probably goes away at some point, but it's interesting that they went straight in that direction. Hard problem.

- Execution of command on new tab does a transition to right sidebar. Not the animation, but the continuity of experience from browser primary UI to web content.
