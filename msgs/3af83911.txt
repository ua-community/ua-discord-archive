yeah you did not feed it my full comment above. i said if you dont trust them you can male a client that has the feature of a verifier endpoint. the client lets say darc browser, submits all actions to verifier and the official server and compares the results. it can warn you that official server behaves bad. everyone who use this app will get guarantees that things are great, if you use the app with someones did not using a verifier supporting client, you will only get the verifying guarantees as fallback gpt stated, eg. denial of service, ordering and point in time reversal. this is not great but would be no dealbreaker for me given the maturity status of the ecosystem.
