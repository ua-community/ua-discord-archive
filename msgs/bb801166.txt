Mozilla 2026-2028 Summary Portfolio Strategy (PDF)

This was buried at the bottom of that post from a few days ago. Long read, but gives you a good sense of *how they're thinking* about the AI transition in the near term, and what they think it means for browsers and the web. A couple of key takeaways from my read of it:

- Mozilla is 100% in on AI as the future of the web/browsers, explicitly saying traditional browsers will be displaced
- The mission comes 2nd, *after* hitting revenue targets - this is reinforced repeatedly
- Aiming for revenue diversification via investments and their spinoff companies making money w/ AI
