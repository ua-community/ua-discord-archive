That’s a good point. I guess the only insurance you have is seeing the actual artist IRL and their track record (pun intended)?

Although there’s a lot of music with multiple producers and lyricists, and that’s maybe making the problem worse.

I wish there was some verification system that would ensure you an artist made a specific work.
